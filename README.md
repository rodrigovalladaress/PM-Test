This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## How to run the project

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Assumptions/Changes

- Gilroy is not a Google font, so I don't have access to the file. Changed it to Roboto as it was kind of similar.
- I wasn't sure what the 'Personal' and 'Institutional' would do, so I chose to have them as button elements. If they are links, they should be anchor elements instead.
- On the top right of the header, there's a Palestine flag with the words 'EN' on the right. I assume this is a language selector and the Palestine flag is an error, so I'm using the UK flag instead to convey that's the English language selected.
- There's not a clear 'max width content' on the designs, so I chose 1400px.
